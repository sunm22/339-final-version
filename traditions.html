			An important aspect of food to me is the culture tied to it. Not only do I want to learn how to cook in general, but I also want to learn about the history of certain Chinese dishes, many of which are associated with important holidays. This requires a set of actions that are twofold. One, is to know what holidays there are on the lunar calendar in the first place. Two, is to learn the story behind why special dishes are served during those times.

		<p>
			Here are the holidays and associated foods that I know thus far:
			<li>Chinese New Year - eat dumplings to usher in prosperity, as they resemble the shape of a gold ingot.</li>
			<li>Mid-Autumn Festival - eat mooncakes to celebrate the full moon, and celebrat the story of Chang E.</li>
			<li>Lantern Festival - eat tang-yuan, as the roundness of the pastry represents the togetherness of family.</li>
			<li>Dragon Boat Festival - eat zong-zi and celebrate the story of Qu Yuan.</li>
